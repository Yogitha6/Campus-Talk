# Campus-Talk
5448 Course Project

Team Members: Aadish, Pallavi, Yogitha

Platform for all the campus students to keep up to date with latest events happening across the campus. People can find other peers across the university with similar interests, say finding a group of people who are interested in Design Patterns or finding
people who want to go for skiing a particular weekend. Users can create forums to initiate discussions and peers can subscribe to the forum to participate in ongoing discussions. Users can interact with each other by posting in the forums or by replying to existing posts. Users could also unsubscribe if they are no longer interested in following a group.
